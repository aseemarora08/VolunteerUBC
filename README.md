# VolunteerUBC

**Background:**
VolunteerUBC, a non-profit organization, is faced with the challenge of recruiting a substantial number of volunteers for community surveys amid the re-opening of COVID-19 restrictions. The organization has requested assistance in designing a robust database system to manage the volunteer recruitment process efficiently.

**Requirements:**

**1. Applicants Module:**
Individuals globally submit applications to volunteer at VolunteerUBC. The database must capture key applicant information, including name, phone number, email, address, and availability for interviews. Additionally, there should be provisions for recording and tracking notes made by the HR department about each applicant, with the ability to add multiple entries on different days.

**2. Interview Screening Process:**
The system needs to facilitate the scheduling of one-on-one or group interviews. For each interview, a list of applicants, along with the date and time, should be maintained. During interviews, interviewers are required to document notes specific to each question asked, ensuring clarity and precision in the evaluation process.

**3. Volunteer Onboarding:**
Upon acceptance of an offer, an applicant transitions to become a VolunteerUBC volunteer. At this point, the application status changes, and the system records the official start date and daily rate for each volunteer.

**4. Training Sessions:**
Volunteers undergo group training sessions to prepare for phone surveys. The database must record details of each training session, including dates, times, and the participants.

**5. Scheduling Shifts:**
Post-training, volunteers are ready to be scheduled for shifts during community surveys. The system should capture the date, time, and a section for noting the tasks to be accomplished during each shift.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Utilize Diagrams.net or a similar tool to create a Business Process Map that visually represents the end-to-end workflow.
   
2. Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using ERDPlus.com, illustrating the relationships between various entities in the system.

3. Transform the ERD into a Relational Schema, identifying primary keys for each table and incorporating necessary foreign keys for relational clarity.

4. Generate SQL code to create the database, ensuring seamless implementation of the envisioned system.

This systematic approach will address VolunteerUBC's needs and provide a structured database solution for managing the recruitment and scheduling processes effectively.
